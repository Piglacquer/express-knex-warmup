# g102-Database
## Welcome to the step-by-step instructions for building our very own g102 database and server with Node, Express, Knex, and Postgresql!

## Tuesday
  We're going to start off by creating a student object for each and every one of you.
  - The format should be like this:
  ```javascript 
    {
        name: '',
        fave_animal: 'photo.url',
        previous_occupation: '',
        hometown_lat: number,
        hometown_long: number,
        useless_superpower: ''
    }
```
- Put it all in a thread in the class channel. We'll use this as seed data for your database.

### Project Setup
  - Create a new folder from within your terminal!
  - Navigate into that folder
  - We need to do three things right off the bat, create a package.json, set up a git repository, and create an app.js
    - ```npm init```
    - ```git init```
    - ```touch app.js```
  - Navigate to your github and create a new repository
    - Copy the link for your git repository
    - Go to your terminal and add a new remote called origin
    - ```git remote add origin URL```
  - Go ahead and add your project, commit, and push to your repo ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---
 
### Express Setup
  Let's get that express server running!
  - Remember what basic dependencies our express server needs?
  - ```npm install express```, that's it!
  - Now build out that basic express server the way we have done before.
    - Create a const called express that requires in express
    - Create another const called app that invokes express
    - Create another const called port that equals ```process.env.PORT``` OR ```whatever port you want it to run on```
    - A tiny bit of information on why you use process.env.PORT [heroku docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/runtime-principles#web-servers)
    - Tell express() to listen to port and then pass in an anonymous function with ```console.log(`listening on ${port}`)``` or something like that.
  - RUN IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS!
    - ```$node app.js```
  - All good? Add, commit, and push to github. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---
    
  Lets write a basic get route now.
  - Below your app.listen give it an ```app.get()```
  - We're going to pass in the route, which will be the base route ```'/'```
  - We're also going to pass in an anonymous function with two parameters, request and response
  - ES5: ```function(request, response){}```
  - ES6: ```(request, response) => {}```
  - Inside of that function, we're going to send a response ```res.send()
  - We'll send back... something... how about ```('THE ROUTE WORKED!')```
  - RUN IT! 
  - Worked? Hooray! Add. Commit. Push. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---

### Knex and PostgreSQL setup (in project)
  Now that we have our basic express server together, we're going to start messing with knex and postgresql
  - Go back to your terminal and ```npm install knex pg```
    - You can install multiple dependencies in one line ðŸ˜Š
    - ```pg``` is the dependency we use for postgres
  - We also need to create a database
    - ```createdb DATABASE_NAME_THAT_MAKES_SENSE_FOR_G102_DATABASE```
  - Okay... We have our dependencies installed and have created a database. What's next?
  - Inside of your project directory you need to run ```knex init```
    - This will create a file called 'knexfile.js'
  - Take a look at that file. It's a configuration file, and it has a bunch of keys within a module.exports, which will make them available to files outside of your knexfile.
  - You'll notice that the top level keys are: development, staging, and production
  - We're not going to mess with staging. Go ahead and delete everything within that key, leaving development and production
  - Also notice that both are using 'sqlite3' as their client. Well, we're not. We're using postgresql.
  - Change the client on both development and production to: ```'pg'```
  - We're also going to need to change the connection for both of them.
    - Connection for development: ```connection: 'postgresql://localhost/DATABASE_NAME_THAT_MAKES_SENSE_FOR_G102_DATABASE```
    - Connection for production: ```connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL```
  - Delete the rest of the key: value pairs, leaving only client and connection for both. We won't need the extra information.
  - Knex is now configured for development and production! ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  - Add. Commit. Push.

### Migrations
  Next, lets make our migrations and seeds
  
  - ```knex migrate:make students```
  - This will make a migration file, the long string of digits before "students" is a timestamp. These files run in chronological order.
  - Open this file (it's in the migrations folder)
  - You'll notice that there are two sections: _exports.up_ and _exports.down_
  - _exports.up_ will be run with ```knex migrate:latest```
    - This command will create the table and the schema
  - _exports.down_ will be run with ```knex migrate:rollback```
    - This command will drop the table and schema
#### exports.up
  - Inside your exports.up, you'll need to write the code to create the table and to create the columns and datatypes (schema) in that table
  - ```return knex.schema.createTable('table_name', (entityInTable) => {}```
  - You'll notice that createTable takes two arguments, the name of your table, and an anonymous function
  - 'entityInTable' is in place of whatever you want to call a specific entity in your table
    - For instance, if your table is named 'students', a good specific entity-name would be 'student'.
  - Inside of the curlies is where you write the code to create your columns.
  - Your table ALWAYS needs a primary key, more info about [primary keys](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-primary-key/)
  - ```entityInTable.increments('id')```
  - Here's some info about column types with [knex](https://knexjs.org/#Schema-Building).
  - And here's an example with the id column included in the migration:
  ```javascript
    return knex.schema.createTable('table_name', (entityInTable) => {
      entityInTable.increments('id')
    }
  ```
#### exports.down
- Inside of your exports.down, you'll need to write the code to drop a table. If you ever need to undo your migration, this is the line that'll do it.
- The syntax looks similar to what you wrote in your exports.up function.
```javascript
    return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists('table_name')
```
#### Time to run it
- Remember how to run your migration? Check line 76.
- DID IT WORK? WOO!!!!! 
    - If it didn't, check the error messages and troubleshoot.


- Add. Commit. Push.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

### Seeds
  - ```knex seed:make 01_students```
  - Your seeds will run in alphabetical order, so their names need to help specify their order.
  - If you look at your seed file you'll see something like this:
    ```javascript
    exports.seed = function(knex, Promise) {
    // Deletes ALL existing entries
      return knex('table_name').del()
      .then(function () {
    // Inserts seed entries
        return knex('table_name').insert([
          {id: 1, colName: 'rowValue1'},
          {id: 2, colName: 'rowValue2'},
          {id: 3, colName: 'rowValue3'}```
         ]);
        });
       };```
  - You will replace ```table_name``` with the name of the table you wish to run this seed on. Pretty simple, right?
  - If you used ```entityInTable.increments('id')```, you won't need to pass an id into your seed file. It will assign that automatically.
  - Make sure that your column names match between your migration file and your seed file! Copy+paste! Use autocomplete!
#### Time to run it
- To get that seed data into your table, use the command: ```knex seed:run```
  - Everything behaving the way it should? Add. Commit. Push.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

  ### Queries Setup
  We now have a new table in our database, with a schema, and some data. Lets make some queries with Knex to reach into that database and grab some data for us.

  #### Database Connection
  - The first thing we need to do is establish a connection to our database. We're going to break this out into a separate file, called 'database-connection.js'
  - Our goal in this file is to make sure that our queries can get into the database that we've created. Without specifying how to access the database, our queries won't be able to carry out their tasks. Simple enough.
  - ```javascript
      // Set our environment
        const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'

        // Use connection info from knexfile
        const config = require('../knexfile')

        // Coordinate the two above
        const configEnv = config[environment]

        // Bring in knex as a library
        const knex = require('knex')

        // Put it all together
        const connection = knex(configEnv)

        // Export so we can use it in our routes
        module.exports = connection
    ```
    - Remember our knexfile? We had two different environments set up, development and production.
    - When you deploy your database, Heroku has an _environment variable_ called ```NODE_ENV```, it's value will be 'production'. If knex doesn't find that environment variable, it will go to 'development'. That's why we only have those two values for environment
    - When we combine the knex file and the environment, we are BRACKET notating into the object exported in our knexfile
    - Since we named our import 'config', it will either be config.production or config.development
    - We then pass those into knex so all the pieces work together.

  #### Writing Queries

- We'll start by creating a queries file in the top level of our project called queries.js.
  - First things first, import that database-connection file we just created
    - Lets call it 'database'
    - ```const database = require('./database-connection')```
- We'll then write a module.exports statement and open some curlies.
  - Inside of those curlies is where we will write our queries.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  
  Our queries file is set up, so lets go ahead and write our first query.
  - We'll call it: listAll
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      listAll(){
            
      }
    }
    ```
  - Inside of ALL of your queries, you will start with a ```return```
  - Since we want to list all of the entities in our table, we can just return the the whole table
    ``` return database('table_name')```
  - THATS IT!
  - Each query we write will share a very similar form. We don't need a function keyword before function name, and we always start with a return.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  - Knex query resources: [Knex Cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/knex), [Knex Docs](https://knexjs.org/#Builder-select).

  ### Running Queries with Express
  We've now written our first query, so lets use it to serve some data through our Express server!
  - Go back to app.js
  - Towards the top, where we were requiring in Express and invoking it, we want to also require in our queries file.
    ```const queries = require('./queries')```
  - Now we have access to everything within the module.exports inside of queries.js!
  - Inside of the app.get we wrote when setting up the server, we're going to utilize that query.
  - Delete: ```res.send('THE ROUTE WORKED')```
  - Now we will call our query, and send the data back to the client:
    ```queries.listAll().then(students => res.send(students))```
  - Save, and run it! If you don't remember where to go once it's running, check the port number you assigned at the top of your app.js
  - DID YOU GET THE DATA? YOU GOT THE DATA!
  - Add. Commit. Push. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

### Deploy to Heroku

- First things first, you'll need a Heroku account. If you haven't done that yet, go ahead and create one. 
- Next, you'll need to install the Heroku CLI
- For instructions, follow this link: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
- After you have logged in, use the ```heroku create``` command within your project to add a new project to heroku and also to add a remote to your local git repository.
    - I suggest you add a name to the end of the create command, like ```heroku create DATABASE_NAME_THAT_MAKES_SENSE_FOR_G102_DATABASE```
- Make sure that you have a new remote added to your project ```git remote -v```
    - You should see both _origin_ and _heroku_
- Now you're nearly there. If we just had a server, you would be ready to deploy, but since we're using a postgresql database on top, there're a few more steps.
- We need to add a database to heroku, to do this, we'll use this command: ```heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev```
- To read more about this: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql
- Now you're ready to deploy!!
- Go ahead and push your project to the heroku remote!
- Once you've done that, you need to run your migrations and seeds on _heroku_, just like we did locally.
    - ```heroku run knex migrate:latest```
    - ```heroku run knex seed:run```
- DID EVERYTHING WORK?! WOO!!!!! YOU NOW HAVE A DEPLOYED SERVER+DATABASE COMBO!
- To find out where your project is deployed, go to your heroku dashboard, click the project you made, then go to settings, and look for the _domain_. Click it and you should go to a page and receive a nice JSON object!
- WOOOOOOO!!
